"I have tried to make this project using React to get the real-time location of officers. "

"Band-o-Bast" 

The hardware used for implementation of this project:
1. ESP8266 NodeMCU Microcontroller
2. LoRa SX1278
3. GPS Neo6M Module
4. MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter
5. OLED 1.5 Inch

This project was presented at the Grand Finale of the Smart India Hackathon 2023.

The watch sends GPS location via a LoRa module to another LoRa module at the receiver's end i.e. to the desktop of the person who will monitor the bandobast. The admin has options to create a bandobast by geofencing a region on their dashboard and add personals to deploy to that region.
